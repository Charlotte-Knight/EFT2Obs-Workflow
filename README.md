# EFT2Obs-Workflow

To create the snakemake environment:
```
curl -Ls https://micro.mamba.pm/api/micromamba/linux-64/latest | tar -xvj bin/micromamba
mv bin snakemake_env
export MAMBA_ROOT_PREFIX=${PWD}/snakemake_env
eval "$(./snakemake_env/micromamba shell hook -s posix)"

micromamba env create -n snakemake -f env.yaml
```

To source the environment do:
```
source env.sh
```

I assume that you have apptainer installed on your system. For the time being, we need to increase the size of the temporary overlay (so you can write inside the container):
```
sudo apptainer config global --set "sessiondir max size" "1024"
```
More details about overlays: [https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/persistent_overlays.html](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/persistent_overlays.html)

One could now run the snakemake command and it will internally pull the docker (converted by apptainer) container. However, I recommend pulling it with apptainer first
```
apptainer pull docker://charlotteknight/eft2obs:LO
```

To run the workflow first run:
```
snakemake --sdm apptainer --apptainer-args "--writable-tmpfs " -c 1
```

You may want to bind some additional directories such that they are visible inside the container. This is done the the `--bind` apptainer arg. For example, to bind the `/vols` directory, instead run:
```
snakemake --sdm apptainer --apptainer-args "--writable-tmpfs --bind /vols /home " -c 1
```

To run on the batch at Imperial College (some minor work may be needed to extend to other condor systems), install some extra packages:
```
cookiecutter --output-dir ~/.config/snakemake gh:Charlotte-Knight/htcondor-ic
```
and then run snakemake with `--profile htcondor` and without `-c 1`. 
```
snakemake --sdm apptainer --apptainer-args "--writable-tmpfs --bind /vols  " --profile htcondor
```
